*THE FOLLOWING DATA LOOK AT MUSCLE MASS FOR LEG MUSCLE'S FOR 
*PARAPALEGIC INDIVIDUALS. MUSCLES ARE ACTIVATED WITH CURRENT 
*(Current) A NUMBER OF TIMES (Number) DAILY FOR A GIVEN LENGTH
*OF TIME (Time), AND A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF REPITITIANS (Rep).  
*WE ARE INTERESTED IN SEEING IN DIFFERENT IF THESE FACTORS INCREASE 
*LEG-MUSCLE MASS.  
*1) FIT A MODEL ASSUMING THE ONLY INTERACTION IS BETWEEN THE CURRENT 
*   AND THE NUMBER OF REPITITIANS.
*2) ASSUMING THE INTERACTION EXISTS. WHAT IS THE AVERAGE DIFFERENCE 
*   BETWEEN CURRENT 1 AND CURRENT 4.
*3) ASSUMING THE INTERACTION EXISTS. WHAT IS THE AVERAGE DIFFERENCE 
*   BETWEEN TREATMENT NUMBER 1 AND NUMBER 3
